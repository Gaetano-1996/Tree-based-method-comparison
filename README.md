# Tree-based method comparison

In this project we explore and compare tree-based methods (CART, bagging, random forest and boosting) in terms of performance and interpretability of results on the benchmark Boston Housing dataset.

The project made usage of the scikit-learn, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
Before proceeding be sure you have installed the necessaries dependencies
running the command:
-pip3 install -r requirements.txt 


The code is divided into:
- AutoTree.py: containing the class created to manage decision tree and methods.
- AutoEnsemble.py: containing the class created to manage decision tree ensemble and methods.
- prjFunc.py : containing the suport function used in the analysis.
- BostonHousing.ipynb: containing the notebook fro the anaysis.
