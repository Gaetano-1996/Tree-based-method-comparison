# Tree-based method comparison

In this project, we explore and compare tree-based methods (CART, bagging, random forest, and boosting) in terms of performance and interpretability of results on the benchmark Boston Housing dataset.

The project made use of the scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
Before proceeding **be sure you have installed the necessary dependencies** running the command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


The project is divided into:
- **src**: containing the source code for classes, methods and functions 
-   -*AutoTree.py*: containing the class created to manage decision trees and methods.
-   -*AutoEnsemble.py*: containing the class created to manage decision tree ensemble and methods.
-   -*utils.py*: containing the support function used in the analysis.
- _BostonHousing.ipynb_: containing the notebook for the analysis.
- _requirements.txt_: self explicative.
- _Boston.csv_: data used for the comparison.
- **main.py**
